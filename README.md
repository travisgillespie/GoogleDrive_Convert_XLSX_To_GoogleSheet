The code in this project will help you convert xlsx (stored in Shared Team Drive1) to Google Sheet (stored in Shared Team Drive2). The xlsx will be converted to Google Sheet, and the Google Sheet will be transferred to a different Shared Drive. The original folder (Shared Drive1) will be unchanged (i.e. additional files will not appear in the folder).
