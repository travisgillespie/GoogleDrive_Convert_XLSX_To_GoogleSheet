# Description

The code in this project will help you convert a xlsx file (stored in one of your team's Shared Drives) to Google Sheet (stored in one of your team's other Shared Drives). The xlsx file will be converted to Google Sheet, and the Google Sheet will be transferred to a different Shared Drive. The original folder (Shared Drive1) will be unchanged (i.e. additional files will not appear in the folder).
